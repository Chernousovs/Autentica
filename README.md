<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


 The project is an ASP.Net Core web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The data source for the application is a CSV file named AW_VIETU_CENTROIDI.CSV, containing information about Latvian places and their coordinates. The application uses the leafletjs JavaScript library to display the locations on a map.

The main feature of the application is to display the most remote places in Latvia based on their geographic location (North, South, East, West) on the map. The leafletjs library allows for interactive maps with various features, such as zooming, panning, and marker placement.

Overall, this project is a simple but useful tool for exploring and visualizing the geographic distribution of Latvian places. It showcases the use of ASP.Net Core, MVC pattern, CSV file data source, and leafletjs library.
